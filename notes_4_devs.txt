RPLidar can be used for obstacle avoidance. 
Run to get the range and angles:
'''
stretch_rp_lidar_jog.py --range
'''

See: iter_measurments() and iter_scans()
https://rplidar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

Output is (quality, angle of lidar point, range distance from the center of the lidar in mm)
The angle == 240 degrees is roughly in the front-facing direction of the robot. (
